Goals
know how to create multiple pages to move between hashing/ encryption/ decrypt/ help etc

Knowing how to make input boxes mandatory, then sending the output of 3 to my classes
ONLY once the 3 have been filled with the correct data (error handling needed here)
Impliment drag and drop for these 3 boxes too

Know how to display my logo / stego 2.10/ a overall design that stays constant between every page
I believe this can be done using mainframe then adding to it on the other frames.
