 Requirements Checklist for a Basic Steganography Program 
Hereâ€™s a key list of what your program needs to do. You can build it modularly: 

 

1. Data Handling 
Convert text message into binary (ASCII to 8-bit binary). 
Optionally compress or encrypt the message for added stealth. 

 

2. Image Processing 
Load the image (e.g., using PIL.Image). 
Check image capacity (can it hold the full message?). 
Convert image pixels into modifiable data (e.g., RGB values). 
Embed the binary data in the LSBs of the image pixels. 
Save the modified image. 

 

3. Message Extraction 
Load the stego image. 
Read the LSBs across the same pixel sequence. 
Convert binary back to ASCII text. 
Optionally decrypt/decompress the message. 

 

4. Key-based Access (optional but good) 
Use a key/password to encrypt/decrypt the message. 
Or use the key to determine: 
Which pixels to modify (e.g., a pseudo-random pattern). 
How deep to hide (e.g., in Red only or RGB). 

 

5. UX Features (Optional) 
CLI flags to encode/decode. 
Message length auto-detection or explicit length prefix. 
Image preview or visual comparison. 
Error handling (e.g., file too small, invalid format). 

6. Extraction Process (The Reverse) 
To decode the message: 
Load the image 
Read pixel values in the same order 
Extract the LSB from each channel
Rebuild the binary message 
Convert every 8 bits to a character 
Stop when: 
You reach a predefined length 
You hit a special end marker (like '1111111111111110') 
You've read all available pixels
