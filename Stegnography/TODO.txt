Need to sort image function, i need to make it so it can select a range of pixels using self.fit
if self.fit is 7 use 7 pixels for example.

Then- split the rgb of these 7 pixels one by one, send them through as a,b,c one pixel at a time.
data structure needs to handle these appropriately then.

Then take the data, it should be appended correctly to self.df
Add this data back to the image basically reversing taking the pixel range tbf.
