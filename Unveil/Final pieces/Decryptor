# This program will take the self.final_str and reverse it till i reaches the input value.
# TODO- create a basic input from unveil program, one that can be replicated consistently for testing-
# This means I will be able to know exactly what data to look for at each step of the way!
# Steps for encrypt- choose txt, flag.txt file name, 123456 shift, 1, 1 options for block 3/4 (need to add this to enc header)
# And the data from enc header, we also need to undo all instances of the table which will
# be close to impossible without altering unveil





# Retrieving all rows from table that were combined to form the self.final_str string-
# is going to be impossible: lets get it done!
# I will first change unveil, i now only want the hash from its output, not the single enc str.
