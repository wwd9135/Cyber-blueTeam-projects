  Project Log - Day [2] - Encryption Tool Progress
Project Overview: This project began with revisiting basic encryption algorithms and revising concepts I learned during CompTIA Security+ and university. The primary goal is to build a customizable Caesar cipher, allowing users to control the encryption process and make the output unique.

Todo today,
Add more digits to our cipher and then our digit list, we should use minimum 6 for the shift, and about 32 for the digit list, they can be RNG if the user wants (add this functionality.)
we need to make the caeser retracable, as when im using random to alter the shift this becomes a hash when i want it to be an encryption service.
Then get creative with your algoritihm, research popular models, make it a complete bitch to crack, we shouldnt need any libraries for this its algorithmic.
