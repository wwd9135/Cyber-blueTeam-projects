Todo today,
Add more digits to our cipher and then our digit list, we should use minimum 6 for the shift, and about 32 for the digit list, they can be RNG if the user wants (add this functionality.)
we need to make the caeser retracable, as when im using random to alter the shift this becomes a hash when i want it to be an encryption service.
Then get creative with your algoritihm, research popular models, make it a complete bitch to crack, we shouldnt need any libraries for this its algorithmic.
