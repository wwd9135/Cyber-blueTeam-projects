  Project Log - Day [1] - Encryption Tool Progress
Project Overview: This project began with revisiting basic encryption algorithms and revising concepts I learned during CompTIA Security+ and university. The primary goal is to build a customizable Caesar cipher, allowing users to control the encryption process and make the output unique.

The cipher will ultimately be retrievable only through a robust cracker (referred to as the "veil" part of the project) or with the original encryption digit used. For more details, check the To-Do List for tomorrow's tasks.
I have also modified the algorithm to create a hash by multiplying the digit by any random number between 1 and 10,000. This transformation ensures the tool can be used for encryption when needed.

Progress Today:
Encryption Algorithm Development:
Developed a basic encryption algorithm, starting with a Caesar cipher. The focus was to build it from scratch and refine it using no external libraries (though random was used). The idea is to keep enhancing the algorithm, making it more complex and secure without relying on pre-built solutions.

Hash Transformation:
I updated the algorithm to treat the cipher as a hash. By multiplying the encryption shift by a random factor between 1 and 10,000, it transitions the tool from a simple cipher to something that behaves more like a hash when desired.

To-Do List for Today:
Develop a basic encryption algorithm, like a Caesar cipher, and improve it without using libraries (except for random functionalities).
If the cipher is not secure enough, begin researching advanced techniques to improve it. Using libraries should be a last resort.
To-Do List for Tomorrow:

Increase Cipher Complexity:
Add more digits to the cipher, expanding the shift to at least 6 digits and the digit list to about 32 entries.
Implement the option for the user to generate random numbers for the cipher and shift digits.
Cipher Retrievability:

Make the Caesar cipher retrievable, especially since using random numbers to alter the shift turns it into a hash. The goal is to preserve its use as an encryption tool.
Algorithmic Innovation:

Get creative with the algorithm. Research popular encryption models and find ways to make the cipher significantly harder to crack.
The aim is to achieve this without using external libraries, focusing on building a strong, algorithmic solution.

Notes:
Keep track of improvements and keep testing the cipher to see if it holds up against potential decryption attempts.
Keep the project growing and donâ€™t hesitate to iterate on new ideas, as this is an ongoing learning process.
