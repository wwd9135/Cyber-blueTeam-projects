  This project began by practicing basic encryption algorithims, and revising my knowledge of encryption I learnt during compTia sec+/ university.



    Todo today-
    Develop an encryption algorithm from scratch, can be basic like a caeser for example. 
      Then improve it as much as you can without using libraries (libs like random can be incorporated of course)
      If it isn't strong enough we can research techniques to develop them and/or use a library if absolutely necessary.
      Make sure to create documentation/cheat sheets for my oneDrive learning log.


      Depending how we get on begin the decryption tool but dont rush part A get that perfect ideally.
