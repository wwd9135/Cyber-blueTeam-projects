  This project began by practicing basic encryption algorithims, and revising my knowledge of encryption I learnt during compTia sec+/ university.
I decided to first make a basic caespher cipher, the aim is to build this, as I want the user to be able to control the output in a way making it more unique.


Ultimately the cipher will only be retrievable with a strong cracker (the veil part of this project)
Or with the original encryption digit used, check todo list for tomorrow for more on this.




    Todo today-
    Develop an encryption algorithm from scratch, can be basic like a caeser for example. 
      Then improve it as much as you can without using libraries (libs like random can be incorporated of course)
      If it isn't strong enough we can research techniques to develop them and/or use a library if absolutely necessary.
      Make sure to create documentation/cheat sheets for my oneDrive learning log.


      Depending how we get on begin the decryption tool but dont rush part A get that perfect ideally. 


Todo tomorrow,
Add more digits to our cipher and then our digit list, we should use minimum 6 for the shift, and about 32 for the digit list, they can be RNG if the user wants (add this functionality.)
we need to make the caeser retracable, as when im using random to alter the shift this becomes a hash when i want it to be an encryption service.
Then get creative with your algoritihm, research popular models, make it a complete bitch to crack, we shouldnt need any libraries for this its algorithmic.
